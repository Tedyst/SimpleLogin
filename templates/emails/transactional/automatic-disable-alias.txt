Hi {{name}}

There are at least 2 emails sent to your alias {{alias.email}} from {{website_email}} that have been refused (or bounced) by your mailbox {{mailbox_email}}.

This is usually due to the email being considered as spam by your email provider.
You can view this email here:
{{ refused_email_url }}


As security measure, we have disabled the alias {{alias.email}}.

Please let us know if you have any question.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
